# Kudos Delight

Kudos Delight is a fun compliment generator that uses Firebase Realtime Database 
to store and fetch compliments. Users can submit new compliments, which are saved 
in the database, and generate random compliments by clicking a button. Built with 
JavaScript, Firebase, and a user-friendly UI, this project is great for learning 
database interactions and building interactive features.
